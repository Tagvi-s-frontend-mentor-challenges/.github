# Tagvi's Frontend Mentor challenge submissions.

Hey, this repository contains [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges that I have completed.

Frontendmentor.io is a website that lets you have fun and learn by doing challenges that they provide.

Nowadays, it is just to have fun, since I don't learn much from these anymore.

## Regarding my code quality.

Most of these challenges are old, although I redo them once in a while. I started this when I really sucked at coding and have improved a lot.

Nowadays, I am too lazy to do these since all the challenges can be done by a junior developer and it just too simple to satisfy me. What ends up happening is that I half-ass things and I might forget to add certain provided details here and there.

Some people go for pixel-perfect implementations here, but I am against it and think that it is a waste of time (Blog post coming after my WIP portfolio is finished).

I hope you can learn something new from my repos.
